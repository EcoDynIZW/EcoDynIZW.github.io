```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Please describe all chunks and leave an empty line between text and chunk

```{r install, eval=3}

```

if you want to create pseudo code (code that should not run but you want to show the output) copy and paste the output of console as text. Use eval=FALSE as chunk option to include this code output.

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
print("hello world")
[1] "hello world"
```



```{r plot, echo=FALSE}

```

please knit the whole document in the end, to test if its working!
