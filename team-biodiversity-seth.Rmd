Understanding how globally threatened species and wildlife communities respond to changing landscapes and efforts towards more sustainable use of forest resources is essential for species conservation and sustainable forest management. For this project, I usitlise camera traps to survey terrestrial wildlife communities within two mixed land-use forest management units containing sustainably logged, natural forest and industrial tree plantations in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo. The overall goal is to improve our understanding of how forest degradation through the implementation of different forest management practices impact wildlife communities.
