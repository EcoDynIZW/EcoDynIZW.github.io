# Welcome to D6!

<div class='highlightbox'>
  <span class='highlight'>
  We are scientists of the Department of Ecological Dynamics at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Berlin, Germany. Our research is focused on understanding ecological dynamics in space and time, at different levels of organisation, from individuals to communities, and across gradients of human altered environments. We investigate how fitness consequences of processes acting at the individual level, such as social behaviour or movements, competition, predator-prey or host-pathogen interactions, shape population and community dynamics, also at evolutionary scales.

## Our Vision

Our ultimate goal is to predict the future viability of wildlife populations and species faced with accelerating environmental change in the anthropocene and to improve landscape scale planning for conservation.

## Our Mission

By developing and using a wide range of modern field techniques, lab analytical methods and especially dynamic and simulation modelling, we aim to advance theory and concepts in ecology and evolution, and to promote the development of computational and analytical toolkits.

## Our Teams

We are organized in three teams spanning the different levels of organisation from the individual to the community level. Check out the three team pages for an overview over current projects, activities and people!
