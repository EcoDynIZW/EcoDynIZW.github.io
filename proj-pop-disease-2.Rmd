Diseases can have a profound impact on populations of wild animals, however, very little is known about how a dynamically (random or seasonal) changing landscape influences the interactions between host species and pathogen. I am using individual-based modelling to investigate different host-pathogen coexistence patterns under the effect of (1) dynamic resource landscapes, (2) the role of dispersal in the evolution of pathogenic virulence as well as the feedbacks of disease evolution on the evolution of movement strategies, and (3) the role of life-history trade-offs between movement strategies and infectivity as equalizing mechanism allowing for coexistence of host and pathogen.
