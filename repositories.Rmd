For each study in the phenotypic responses to climate with selection (PRCS) dataset, the changes in morphological traits are shown in grey and the changes in phenological traits are shown in black. Each study is identified by the publication identity, the trait and the species. Studies are sorted by trait category (black: phenological; grey: morphological), and within it by species, trait name and publication identity. Overall, phenological traits in both the PRCS dataset (black) and the PRC dataset (dark blue) were negatively affected by temperature. Morphological traits were not associated with temperature in the PRCS (grey) and showed a tendency to a negative association with temperature in the PRC dataset (cyan). In the PRC dataset there was significant variation among taxa in the effect of temperature on phenological (blue) traits, and a tendency to such variation for morphological traits (cyan).'>

(f) For all 200 simulation runs per combination of movement rule (correlated random walk, habitat-dependent movement and competition-driven movement) and landscape scenario (homogeneous and three levels of spatial heterogeneity), we recorded the first and last week of the outbreak, and classified the runs as either ‘non-persistent’ (less than 10 years since pathogen release; grey) or ‘persistent’ (more than 10 years; orange).
