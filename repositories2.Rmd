<div class="card-content">The purpose of our conceptual model was to assess whether and how an age-dependent pattern of between-group interactions, which increases social network modularity, consistently increased the probability of epidemic fade-out across a large range of host and pathogen life history traits. This trait occurs in social species with communal nurseries where juveniles have no contact with members of other social groups during their development. We modelled a contagious pathogen spreading through physical contact and/or spatial proximity, e.g., via aerosols, and inducing lifelong immunity following infection. All model parameters below can easily be changed to tailor the model to host-specific life histories and pathogen traits.</div>

<div class="card-content">We used a spatially explicit individual-based eco-epidemiological model originally developed by Scherer et al. (2020). It is based on earlier models considering neighbourhood infections only which was developed by Kramer-Schadt et al. (2009) and Lange et al. (2012). The model by Scherer et al. (2020) relies on individual movement decisions of host individuals, i.e. long-distance roaming movement of males (hereafter termed ‘movement’), a process important for disease transmission. We further modified the model by adding spatiotemporal landscape dynamics representing changing resource availability, a response of movement decisions to that landscape and a resource-based mortality. A complete and detailed model description following the modified ODD (Overview, Design concepts, Detail) protocol (Grimm et al., 2020, 2006) is provided in the supplementary material. The NetLogo model and the R code to analyse the simulation results are available on Zenodo Kürschner et al. (2021)</div>

<div class="card-content">The spatially explicit agent‐based eco‐epidemiological model is based on the study by Kramer-Schadt et al. (2009) and subsequent modifications by Lange et al. (2012). In the original model transmission is based on nearest‐neighbour group mixing processes, where infection pressure within and between neighbouring groups is based on constant transmission probabilities without movement of the host individuals. The modified version presented here assumes explicit phenomenological, fully imposed movement patterns and mechanistic movement based on individual decisions of hosts. In the paper we present essential parts of the model necessary for understanding model outcomes. The full model description following the overview, design concepts and details (‘ODD’) protocol (Grimm et al. 2006, 2010) is provided in the Supplementary material Appendix 1. The NetLogo model and the R code to analyse the simulation results are available on Zenodo (Scherer et al. 2019).</div>

<div class="card-content">The goal of adRes package is to provide the data and the exact workflow required to reproduce the analyses for the manuscript 'Adaptive responses of animals to climate change are most likely insufficient' by Radchuk et al. Nature Communications (2019)'. Only the data whose dataholders agreed to sharing their data could be made available. Therefore, the data distributed with the package is a subset of the complete dataset used for the manuscript.

The package was conceived to document the analyses presented in the above-mentioned paper. Therefore, the package will only be updated if necessary to keep compatibility with other packages, so that the code represented here works well.</div>

<div class="card-content">Predicting the impact of disease epidemics on wildlife populations is one of the twenty-first century’s main conservation challenges. The long-term demographic responses of wildlife populations to epidemics and the life history and social traits modulating these responses are generally unknown, particularly for K-selected social species. Here we develop a stage-structured matrix population model to provide a long-term projection of demographic responses by a keystone social predator, the spotted hyena, to a virulent epidemic of canine distemper virus (CDV) in the Serengeti ecosystem in 1993/1994 and predict the recovery time for the population following the epidemic. Using two decades of longitudinal data from 625 known hyenas, we demonstrate that although the reduction in population size was moderate, i.e., the population showed high ecological ‘resistance’ to the novel CDV genotype present, recovery was slow. Interestingly, high-ranking females accelerated the population’s recovery, thereby lessening the impact of the epidemic on the population.</div>
