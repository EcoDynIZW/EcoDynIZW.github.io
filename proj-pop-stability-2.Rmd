Large changes in Earth’s climate are apparent, and there is some evidence that populations and communities respond to climate change. In order to tackle this issue, we study the effect of different levels of climatic variation on population and community dynamics, by using theoretical modelling. I also try to understand tipping points and early warning in populations and communities, by studying fluctuations in traits and demographic rates.
