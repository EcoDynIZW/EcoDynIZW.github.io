  Wildlife has to cope with many challenges in the Anthropocene, but data are often too scarce and messy to predict the future fate of populations and communities under global change. To disentangle processes and drivers behind ecological and evolutionary dynamics of wildlife populations and communities, we combine field work with advanced data analysis and the development of concepts with designing stochastic simulation models. We use forecasting techniques to project scenarios of population and community change under disturbances. With this, we contribute to applied and theoretic ecology and biodiversity conservation under global change.

To understand how populations and communities react to global change we study how their stability is affected by disturbances. To this end we model disturbances of different types and intensity and measure several stability metrics.

* **Animal responses to climate change**
* **Environmental variation effects on stability of populations and communities**

Pathogens are an integral part of biodiversity, influencing population dynamics of their hosts and playing an important functional role in shaping community structure. Here, our aim is to understand the effect that species as ‘mobile pathogen links’ with their different movement types and life-history strategies have on disease distribution, spread, persistence and evolution.

Urbanisation poses risks and opportunities for wildlife. We investigate how species cope with these everyday challenges by analysing the spatial factors and species interactions that underlie their distributions along a rural to urban gradient and by making inference on their behavioral plasticity.

Wildlife faces big challenges persisting in human-dominated landscapes. We model their population dynamics, viability and connectivity using individual-based models on a spatially-explicit basis, with the aim of supporting wildlife management and conservation.

* **Jaguar connectivity and conservation prioritization in Central America**
* **Modelling genetic processes to support the conservation management of Eurasian lynx**
