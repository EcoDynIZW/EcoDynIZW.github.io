```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

- why contributing?
  You have a nice piece of code? You made a cool package?

- how to contribute?
  You have to clone the [EcoDynIZW.github.io](x-github-client://openRepo/https://github.com/EcoDynIZW/EcoDynIZW.github.io) repository, create a post by using the _post_template.rmd and make a merge request when done.
  You have to create a folder with the name of the post and save the rmd in there (maybe we create a function for that, like our own post wiki function or so).
  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
distill::create_post()

post_fun <- function(post_name){
  if(dir.exists(here::here("_posts", post_name)) == FALSE){
  dir.create(here::here("_posts", post_name))
  }
  file.copy("_template_posts.Rmd", here::here("_posts", post_name, paste0(post_name, ".rmd")))
}

```

  

- please use the spell check before knitting and pushing the post

- please check if the code is running (in a reasonable time) as we have to rebuild the page sometimes

- examples for styling like `plot` for functions examples

- maybe show how to hide code? Or how to add pseudo code? 

- prepare/update the "_post_template.rmd"
