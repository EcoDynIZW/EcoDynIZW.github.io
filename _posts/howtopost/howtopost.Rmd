You have a nice piece of code? You have developed a cool package? You have something to share within (or even outside) our department?
  
You can share it with a blogpost on our EcoDynIZW Website by following these simple steps:

### Step 0 Install D6 package
  - if not installed, install the d6 package. It provides several functions for our department as well as the blogpost template
  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("EcoDynIZW/d6")
```

### Step 1 Use blogpost template

  - Create a new rmarkdown script by using the **D6 Blogpost Template**.

### Step 2 Name the script 

  - Fill in a proper name, please use uppercase for the name.   
  - Write a short description. Please have in mind that this description will appear on the blogpost listing page as well as in the post.
  - Fill in some categories. You can find some examples on the webpage wiki section
  - Enter your name and the date of the post in the given format
  
### Step 3 Fill the script

  - Describe briefly what you will show us and describe each chunk separately. 
  - leave a line of space between text and chunk for separating text and chunk output.
  - Please use the chunk options to name chunks, hide them or ignore them in the knitting process. This will help later to find possible errors.
  
### Step 4 Knitting

  - Knit the post and check if the knitted document looks as desired.
  - Send the script to the data manager for a short review.

### Step 5 Review

  - Wait for eventual comments of the data manager and if there are any include them and send again the corrected script

### Step 6 Done
  
  - The blog post will appear after the data manager published it on the website 
  
  
  

### General tips for posting

- Please use the spell check before knitting and pushing the post.

- Please check if the code is running (in a reasonable time) as we have to rebuild the page sometimes.

- Use styling like `r knitr::asis_output("\u0027")`plot`r knitr::asis_output("\u0027")`  for functions examples.

- Try to use examples that can be easily recreated within the script.
