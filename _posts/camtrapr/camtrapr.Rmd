[camtrapR](https://github.com/jniedballa/camtrapR): Manage camera trap data in R

camtrapR is a package for camera trap data management in R.

## Installation

You can install the release version of camtrapR from CRAN:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages("camtrapR")
```

or the latest GitHub version (containing recent changes and new features) via:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# install.packages("remotes")
# install.packages("R.rsp")
remotes::install_github("jniedballa/camtrapR", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

For installation from GitHub make sure package R.rsp is available. build_vignettes = TRUE is necessary since v 2.1.1. due to the new static vignettes.

You can also install a previous version (e.g. if a recent update broke the code you need to run urgently) via:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
remotes::install_version(package = "camtrapR", version = "2.0.3")
```

## Exiftool

Numerous important camtrapR functions read EXIF metadata from JPG images (and videos). This is done via Exiftool, a free and open-source sofware tool developed by Phil Harvey and available for Windows, MacOS and Linux.

To make full use of camtrapR, you will need Exiftool on your system. You can download it from the Exiftool homepage. Please follow the installation instruction in vignette 1 and the Exiftool website.

You may not need Exiftool if you do not work with image files, but only use camtrapR to create input for occupancy or spatial capture-recapture models from existing record tables.
