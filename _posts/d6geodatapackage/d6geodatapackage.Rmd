 Learn how to use the {d6geodata} R package that provides functions for accessing data from the Geodata archive of the d6 department. The two functions *geo_overview()* and *get_geaodata()* are the main components for all members of the EcoDyn Department. Several other functions are within this package but only meant to be used by the Geodata Manager of the Department.

The [`{d6geodata}` package](https://github.com/EcoDynIZW/d6geodata) aims to access the data from the Geodata archive of the EcoDyn Department for members only!

The two main functions are:

- geo_overview() 
- get_geodata()



```{r install, eval=3}
devtools::install_github("EcoDynIZW/d6geodata")
library(d6geodata)
```

If you want to get geodata we already have in our Geodata archive you have two options: go on the EcoDyn Website, click on wikis and select [Geodata](https://ecodynizw.github.io/geodata.html). There you'll find several raster layers and vector data with plots and metadata. In the metadata section, you'll find the folder_name. You can copy this and use this together with *get_geodata()* function to get the data from our PopDynCloud. Another option is the function called *get_overview()*. There you can select which data and from which location you want to have a list of data we have. 

```{r example geo_overview, eval=FALSE}
#d6geodata::geo_overview("C:/PopDynCloud")
```

![](man/get_overview_example_2.PNG)

Now you can nopy the name of one of the layers and paste it into the get_geodata function

```{r example get_geodata}
corine <-
  d6geodata::get_geodata(
    data_name = "corine_berlin_2015_20m_03035_tif",
    path_to_cloud = "E:/PopDynCloud",
    download_data = FALSE
  )
```

If you set download_data = TRUE the data will be download and copied to your data-raw folder. If the data-raw folder doesn't exist, it will create one.

# Additional functions

The three functions *plot_binary_map()*, *plot_qualitative_map()* and plot *plot_quantitative_map()* can be used to add the respective color sceams we used for the Geodata wiki page, but for raster data only!

```{r plotting functions, eval=FALSE}
p_base_map + plot_binary_map(tif = tif)
p_base_map + plot_qualitative_map(tif = tif)
p_base_map + plot_quantitative_map(tif = tif)
```
