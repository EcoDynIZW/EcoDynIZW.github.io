  Globally mammalian biodiversity is declining at an alarming rate as a result of widespread habitat loss and degradation, and unsustainable hunting. We study how these anthropogenic drivers impact the distribution and abundance of ground dwelling mammals. In our field projects we use camera-traps and iDNA (invertebrate derived DNA) metabarcoding to assess species occurrences and we employ statistical models that investigate how anthropogenic drivers affect species distribution. We develop standardized methods and strategies for rigorous biodiversity assessments in order to provide robust scientific baseline data that allow monitoring species-specific and community-wide trends over time. In our work we regularly collaborate closely with local stakeholders and decision makers in order to integrate our data and results directly into wildlife and conservation management policy.

**Andreas Wilting**, Deputy Department and Team Lead —  ecologist and evolutionary biologist with strong interest in species conservation, interested in methods and tools to study species distributions and to use these biodiversity data to target conservation efforts.

**Dr. Jan Axtner**, Data Management — data manager, ecologist and evolutionary geneticist, finds ways how to produce, store and handle large amounts of data of modern high-throughput biodiversity assessments.
