Our research is focused on understanding ecological dynamics in space and time, at different levels of organisation, from individuals to communities, and across gradients of human altered environments. We investigate how fitness consequences of processes acting at the individual level, such as social behaviour or movements, competition, predator-prey or host-pathogen interactions, shape population and community dynamics, also at evolutionary scales.\r\n\r\nHow to contact us?\r\nEmail: assist6[at]izw-berlin.de\r\nAddress:\r\nLeibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research\r\nDepartment of Ecological Dynamics\r\nAlfred-Kowalke-Str. 17\r\nD-10315 Berlin, Germany\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nTL;DR: Guidelines in a Nutshell\r\n\r\nGeneral Information\r\nImportant lab information (server access, responsibilities,…) can be found on our cloud in the folder Lab_Orga/Important_Information.\r\nWhen sharing documents, please use use the following syntax for the file name: lastname_topic_YYYYMMDD.docx. Do not use v1, latest or similar suffixes.\r\nAn overview of geo-spatial data sets is available in our geodata wiki.\r\nTo fulfill the requirement of a retention period of 10 years for all projects, follow our rules how to set up, maintain, and archive projects (see below).\r\nProjects\r\nCreate a new project for every study (i.e. publication).\r\nName project folder using our unified syntax: species_where_what_who.→ e.g. sciurus_vulgaris_de_camtrap_kramer_s\r\nComply with our obligatory project folder structure.→ easily to set up with our d6 R package: d6::new_project().\r\nTrack and control changes of source codes: set up version control.\r\nFor a corporate chart style, please use our d6 ggplot2 theme: d6::theme_d6().\r\nTransfer your repository to our GitHub organization at the end of a project.\r\nAsk Moritz Wenzler-Meya (wenzler[at]izw-berlin.de) for help if needed.\r\nAdvice for Students (BSc | MSc | PhD)\r\nPlan regular supervisory meetings at least 3 months ahead.\r\nPrepare for the meeting! Collect recent achievements, potential problems, and open questions. Provide a timeline for upcoming tasks.\r\nWrite the minutes of the meeting and send it to your supervisor(s).\r\n\r\nStart writing your thesis early enough and attend our “write now” meetings.\r\nRegularly send drafts to your supervisor(s) to get feedback.\r\nAllow for sufficient time to read and respond (2-4 weeks).\r\n\r\nTable of Content\r\nGeneral Information\r\nConducting BSc/MSc/PhD Projects\r\nOrganizing Workflows\r\nProject Folders\r\nData Backup\r\nManuscript Submissions/Revisions\r\nGitHub repository\r\nAppendices\r\nScripting\r\nSpatial Data Information\r\nWhat Nature Says…\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Information\r\nThe department is composed of three teams on (1) Individual Dynamics, (2) Population Dynamics and (3) Biodiversity Dynamics.\r\nStephanie Kramer-Schadt is the department head and leader of the Population Dynamics team. Conny Landgraf is the assistant of the department head; she can assist with administrative duties (e.g. contracts, travel sheets, etc.). Moritz Wenzler-Meya and Jan Axtner are responsible for data management, data storage and the working group’s R code collection. As each department member has a specific area of expertise, we created an expert list (see 1.3) if you need help on specific topics. PhD students and scientists are obliged to update this expert list with their own skills and responsibilities as well.\r\nFor information on the Department, check our webpage or subscribe to our Twitter account (@EcoDynIZW) for news about papers, helpful R-code, courses or scientific positions.\r\nTeams of the Department of Ecological Dynamics:\r\nIndividual Dynamics – PI: Sarah Benhaiem & Sonja Metzger (field coordination)\r\nPopulation Dynamics – PI: Stephanie Kramer-Schadt & Viktoriia Radchuk\r\nBiodiversity Dynamics – PI: Andreas Wilting & Rahel Sollmann\r\nAdministrative support\r\nConny Landgraf\r\nTel: -466\r\nEmail: assist6[at]izw-berlin.de or landgraf[at]izw-berlin.de\r\nData Managers\r\nDr. Jan Axtner\r\nTel: -342\r\nEmail: axtner[at]izw-berlin.de\r\nMoritz Wenzler-Meya\r\nTel: -342\r\nEmail: wenzler[at]izw-berlin.de\r\nIn-house experts / scientists / responsibilities\r\nWho does what in the department? Tasks and expertise as well as meeting dates and protocols can be found in the IZW Wolke.\r\n↑ Jump back to top.\r\nConducting BSc/MSc/PhD Projects\r\nFor PhD students: please read the IZW PhD guidelines (\\\\izw-daten-8\\Alle\\GUEST\\Doktorand(inn)en\\IZW-PhD-rules) carefully and follow the instructions (e.g. when you have to give an introduction talk). For any question about these guidelines, contact the PhD coordinators Gábor Czirják (czirjak[at]izw-berlin.de) and Sarah Benhaiem (benhaiem[at]izw-berlin.de).\r\nMeetings\r\nRegular meetings with your supervisor often help to avoid a waste of time (see also Appendix C). It is in the responsibility of the student to organize and schedule regular meeting with his/ her supervisor or the team.\r\nYou can either arrange a fixed date with your supervisor (e.g. first Monday of every month) or schedule them on demand. Please find an agreement with your supervisor how to handle this best. Please keep in mind that any non-regular meeting should be planned at least two weeks ahead.\r\nUse the IZW outlook calendar to schedule meetings with supervisors and colleagues (if you have an IZW Email address). That is: create the entry in the calendar and ‘invite’ the others, so that the date/ location appears in each calendar, with sufficient notice time for the automated reminder (i.e. 1 day/ 1 hr).\r\nPrepare the meetings: Think carefully about your problems/questions and write your agenda (what you want to discuss) before the meeting, make suggestions for your solution(s) and ask the supervisors/collaborators to comment on your solution(s).\r\nWrite the minutes of the meeting and save it in the project folder (we give instructions about this project folder below 3.1.). Minimum information needed: (1) date of meeting, (2) name of participants, (3) questions or problems discussed, (4) main solutions suggested and (5) aims or results to prepare for the next meeting. Write down agreements of the responsibilities of all collaborators.\r\nPresent your project progress regularly in the department meetings, also to get feedback and discuss problems you ran into.\r\nThesis writing\r\nStart writing the thesis early enough. Write simple and concise sentences based on what is known in the literature. Join a ‘pub club’ (i.e. retreats for writing), e.g. Team 2 has regular meetings on jointly discussing drafts of each other. Please also read the instructions (Under construction) for how to write good scientific papers.\r\nArrange with your supervisor how and in what form you report progress. Getting regular feedback for chapters or even just paragraphs might keep you from running into dead ends. When asking for revisions plan in sufficient time for the reviewers to read and respond (1-3 weeks, depending on the amount of text).\r\nFor PhD students: A first complete manuscript draft should be ready after ~ 1 year after starting time.\r\nSend the final version of your manuscript/thesis to all supervisors/colleagues at least 4 weeks before the submission date and keep in mind that you might have to revise it.\r\n↑ Jump back to top.\r\nOrganizing Workflows\r\nTo store data and results, the IZW follows the DFG-guidelines for good scientific practice. In our department, we often use “scripting” (written code of different programming languages) to process and analyze data, and make results reproducible. Work is structured and organized in projects and each project will get a project ID from the data administrators of the department. We consider a project to be a self-contained topic, e.g. analyses for a manuscript, thesis chapter, etc. For each project a separate folder is created and all relevant scripts, results, the lab-book, documents, literature, minutes of meetings etc. related to this project are to be kept in that main folder. For documents (not for scripts!) use your surname, type of document, project name and in the end the date (YYYYMMDD) as version numbers for file names (kramer_manuscript_lynxibm_20201231.docx) and do not use names like doc_final.docx, doc_finalfinal.docx, doc_lastversion.docx etc. It should contain all information needed to repeat the study and conduct follow-up studies. Whenever possible use the standardized project/folder structure shown in section 3.1. Each project or subproject should have a concise but meaningfully electronic lab-book (see section X.Z) that allows to follow the workflow and the decisions made in it.\r\nProject workflow\r\nContact the Data Managers (Jan Axtner or Moritz Wenzler-Meya) of the respective teams to organize your project ID, get server access and how to arrange your workspace best. To setup a project folder, we ask you to follow the setup:\r\nUse the standardized project folder structure! (see Project Folder Structure, d6 R package and GitHub)\r\nMake an outline of the structure separately in your electronic lab-book (see 3.3.1), to indicate what to find in each folder and keep it updated.\r\nPlease hand over the raw data to the data manager before starting your project analysis, to avoid accidental data losses.\r\nStore the raw data, e.g. data from field work, in the folder named data-raw. Use a folder named output to store data created from the raw data (e.g. after data cleaning or editing). This should also be the place where the master table is located, i.e. the data set of all subsequent analyses. If needed you can have a temporary subfolder in the “output” folder for everyday work and analysis trials. Empty the temporary folder regularly. Plots and figures should be stored in the plots folder. Scripts should be stored in the R folder. Documents like manuscripts, proposals, etc. should be stored in the docs folder. Save important, computational or labour intensive interim results or final results. Use appropriate subfolders such as interim-results_<date> or final-results_<date>.\r\nReproducibility\r\nTo ensure reproducibility and for your own sake always try to script your work! If possible use R, Python, SQL, etc. for analyses and avoid manual / mouse commands (e.g. ‘clicking’ in ArcGIS, QGIS etc.). If you cannot use scripts, use tools such as the model-builder in ArcGIS or QGIS and save the drag & drop model builder scripts.\r\nDocumentation\r\nProject documentation is not a final task, but an ongoing process starting from day one. DFG guidelines for Safeguarding and Storing of Primary Data states ‘Primary data as the basis for publications shall be securely stored for ten years in a durable form in the institution of their origin.’ Hence, at the end of a research project, you have to hand over a single well-documented folder per project (usually a paper on the respective subject, or the BSc thesis) along with all original data. The project folder should contain all project related documents and data (e.g. simulation model codes, simulation results, scripts for statistical analysis, scripts for tables and figures, manuscripts, important work documents, applications, permits, reports, etc.) as well as a the final version of a thesis or paper. Unfinished work (data from conducted experiments that were not analyzed or published) should contain the above documents as far as possible, including a very detailed method description. For the ease of documentation effort please follow the section (3.3.1).\r\nElectronic lab-book\r\nAt the start of each new project, create an electronic lab-book to document your workflow and decisions therein. It is of major importance that you keep this lab-book updated. For the ease of use we recommend simple .doc files (MS Word, Libre Office etc.) to keep record of our work. Write down important thoughts, things you have tried, also failed experiments. Try to use clear and comprehensible notes. Although this generates some additional effort you will realize soon that it will help you and others to track your work and make it reproducible. We highly recommend to use GitHub as version control of your project. You have to connect your GitHub account to the EcoDynIZW organization on GitHub to share code with colleagues. Please create repositories as part of this organization. It is mandatory to hand over the electronic lab-book to the institute as part of the ‘Safeguarding and Storing of Primary Data’ regulation of the German Research Council DFG after finishing your project.\r\nTo document scripting we recommend to use R Markdown (.rmd) files if possible. Between your code chunks you should annotate the script with everything that is necessary to understand and follow the code. Additionally, if you push new code to GitHub for version control, you have to comment on your committed code as well. It may be necessary to have an additional word document.\r\n↑ Jump back to top.\r\nProject Folder Structure\r\nA new project can be started by installing the d6 R-package. Running new_project() with a unique and descriptive name for your project (see below) will create a full scaffolding structure for all your future analysis steps. If you like, you can also specify a path and the project will be created there.\r\nPlease create repositories on the EcoDynIZW account and not on your private\r\naccount!\r\nRoot project folder\r\nName it like:\r\nspecies|topic_country|simu_method|approach_surname_firstletterofgivenname\r\ne.g. unicornus_wl_sdm_smith_j (unicornus project in wonderland, species distribution model from John Smith) or stability_simu_rpackage_smith_j\r\nEverything should be written in small letters.\r\nAvoid spaces or hyphen in the path to the file.\r\nSpecies name should be in latin and please use your surname and the first letter of your given name at the end.\r\nCountry should be the international abbreviation.\r\nThe root project folder should hold:\r\nRproj file: your main file for your R project (if used) — do not confuse this with R-scripts!\r\nWe highly recommend to use R, but if it is necessary to use another programming language and/or program please use the same structure as described in the following:\r\n\r\ndata: A folder that contains the complete data, with sub folders for raw (e.g. telemetry data, experiment results, electrophoresis images, vegetation survey plots, species lists, etc.) and processed data. If spatial data is used, placde them in a dedicated geo folder.\r\nDo not use MS Excel files use .csv or .txt files to store/ save data.\r\nMetadata belonging to the raw data should be provided in a separate file but it should be given the same name with an additional suffix as the raw data file, e.g. area1_specieslist.txt or area1_specieslist_metadata.txt\r\n\r\ndocs: A folder that contains anything related with project administration e.g. applications, permits, grants, timeline, research proposal, the electronic lab-book.\r\nresults: A folder that contains results from your data wrangling and analyses.\r\nplots: A folder that contains all produced images for the data exploration, presentations, and publications.\r\nscripts: A folder that contains all scripts that are used within the project.\r\nIf you need additional subfolders add them. Please use also second-level subfolders inside the subfolders to keep a clear and tidy structure.\r\nThe main folder structure created in the root directory should look like this:\r\n.\r\n└── unicornus_wl_sdm_smith_j\r\n    ├── data\r\n    ├── docs\r\n    ├── results\r\n    ├── plots\r\n    └── scripts\r\nThe full scaffolding structure including all subdirectories and\r\nadditional files looks like this:\r\n. \r\n└── unicornus_wl_sdm_smith_j\r\n    ├── .Rproj.user          —  Rproject files\r\n    ├── data                 —  main folder data\r\n    │    ├── processed       —  processed tabular data files\r\n    │    │    └── geo        —  processed geospatial data files\r\n    │    └── raw             —  raw tabular data files\r\n    │    │    └── geo        —  raw geospatial data files\r\n    ├── docs                 —  documents main folder\r\n    │   ├── admin            —  administrative docs, e.g. permits \r\n    │   ├── literature       —  literature used for parametrization + manuscript\r\n    │   ├── manuscript       —  manuscript drafts (main + supplement)\r\n    │   ├── presentations    —  talks and poster presentations\r\n    │   └── reports          —  rendered reports\r\n    ├── results              —  explorative plots, tables etc. (except final figures)\r\n    ├── plots                —  final figures for manuscript and supplementary material\r\n    ├── scripts              —  script files (e.g. .R, .Rmd, .Qmd, .py, .nlogo)\r\n    │   └── zz_submit.R      —  final script to run before submission\r\n    ├── .gitignore           —  contains which files to ignore for version control\r\n    ├── README.md            —  contains project details and package dependencies\r\n    └── project.Rproj        —  Rproject file: use to start your project\r\n↑ Jump back to top.\r\nData Backup\r\nImportant: backup your work! Make copies of raw data/files and scripts and save it in another location if you work on private computers. PhD students should work on the M-drive or the U-drive, never directly on the C-drive of the computer.\r\nManuscript Submissions/Revisions\r\nWhen you are submitting a manuscript create a copy of the related subproject folder and add a suffix submission_1_<JournalAbbreviation>. This copy shall be stored and never changed—we recommend to zip this folder! When conducting a revisions or resubmission, copy the folder to submission_2_<JournalAbbreviation> and revise the paper.\r\nPlease find additional information on ‘how to write a scientific paper’, how to avoid statistical pitfalls or how to organize workflows here.\r\nGitHub repository\r\nThe final step after your paper gets published is to make the GitHub repository public (or create a repository if you haven’t before). The repository should contain clean code and data that runs properly. If you are using R, please make sure to use a R-Project with the given folder structure (see appendix A).\r\nThe title of the repository should contain the last name of the first author, the year, and the abbreviation of the journal (e.g. Smith_2023_Science). Please add the title of the paper as the description (in quotation marks). Please provide the reference of the paper, including the DOI as a hyperlink, and the abstract in the README file. Add further notes on the files contained and the scripts if needed. Please use this template:\r\n# Smith et al. (2023) *Science*\r\n\r\n> **Richard Smith**, Don Joe Radchuk & **Jane Head** (2023): Study title. \r\n*Science* 1-2. DOI: [doi-goes-here](https://doi.org/doi-goes-here)\r\n\r\nAbstract text.\r\n\r\n## Scripts\r\n\r\n... more notes if needed\r\n\r\nAdd the title in quotation marks as the description and the DOI as link to the repository about (right upper corner). For examples see study repositories on our GitHub).\r\nFinally, make sure to turn the visibility to public and transfer the ownership to the EcoDynIZW GitHub organization. If you have need help or have questions please ask the data manager for help.\r\n↑ Jump back to top.\r\nAppendices\r\nAppendix A) Scripting\r\nGeneral recommendations\r\nWrite the author, name and date in a header (you can use the d6 package templates for this as well).\r\nKeep code in scripts as concise as possible.\r\nUse in-line comments to explain your code that others can follow your code.\r\nIf possible, use dynamic paths (i.e. see R-package here).\r\nAlways set variables/ parameters at the top of your script; do not set values somewhere inside the code as this is error prone, because these values tend to be forgotten to get changed when updating a script. The same applies to loading packages. Please also make sure to only load packages that are really needed and remove those that you are not using for the final analysis.\r\nSave the output of a script as .rds file to smoothly load it in the next script. Additionally, save the output in a file format usable beyond R, e.g. use .csv or .txt if you want to save tabular data or GeoTiff if you want to save a raster map.\r\nUse separate scripts to create figures of publishable quality (700 dpi) from the results. Use a vector graphics format like pdf.\r\nFor simulation studies: Include all scripts, e.g. additional model code, batch files with simulated parameters, simulated landscapes and simulation results, and files used for the analyses.\r\nR\r\nStick to the Rstudio style guide to ensure readability of code.\r\nIf you are using RStudio, make sure to set the following under Tools > Global Options > General > Basic:\r\nuntick “Restore .RData into workspace at startup”\r\nset “Save workspace to .RData on exit:” to “Never”\r\nuntick “Always save history (even when not saving .RData)” (recommended)\r\n\r\nA screenshot of the RStudio general settingsWe recommend using R-Studio projects and R Markdown documents when scripting in R. If you use another “integrated development environment” (IDE) make sure you can provide versioned plain R scripts using a relative path to the used data files.\r\nImplement version control by using GitHub. If you install packages or use scripts and code chunks from GitHub provided by others, be aware to acknowledge the code developer prior to publication of scripts.\r\nDo not save the R history or the R environment. Always start a fresh and an empty R session to avoid artifacts by using objects of functions that were not defined in your script. More details here: https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/.\r\nIf possible use log files to document messages and errors.\r\nPython\r\nIn general we recommend using Jupyter notebooks.\r\n[under construction]\r\nNetlogo\r\n[under construction]\r\nQGIS\r\nIn general we recommend doing GIS analyses in R. If you have to use QGIS use Python as scripting language. However, the RQGIS package provides a great opportunity to script complete workflows in QGIS by using R. Moreover, you can include R scripts in the QGIS toolbox.\r\n[under construction]\r\n↑ Jump back to top.\r\nAppendix B) Spatial Data\r\nIf you are working with spatial data please have the following in mind:\r\nAlways check the projection (cartographic reference system (CRS)) of your data. Depending on what you want to do it could be necessary to change the CRS system, i.e. from an angular unit (like GPS data) to a projected unit in meters. BUT sometimes you cannot easily change it or it will drastically change your data.\r\nIf you want to save you spatial data, please save it as Geopackage (.gpkg) or raster data GeoTiff (.tif). Please give a clear name, document the filename in your lab book and add the EPSG code of your CRS to the file name. Always use utf-8 as file encoding.\r\nIf you are not sure how to handle your spatial data please contact Moritz Wenzler-Meya, the GIS manager, for help.\r\nWhen using spatial data give clear names for maps ≤ 13 characters without special characters or spaces.\r\nWrite down the cartographic reference system (CRS) at the end of the file name, e.g. filename_4326.\r\nAlways use utf-8 encoding, NEVER use the system setting. If you have to use different character encoding settings, then name the used encoding in the filename.\r\nSave the data as geopackage (.gpkg, recommended but cannot be used via ArcGis) or shapefile. Geopackages should be the first choice as the format is much quicker in every task (loading, saving, changing and computing), less limited and OGC-Standard (Open Geospatial Consortium). Be aware, that shapefiles have many limitations e.g. max 7 characters for column names. Further information is listed in Appendix B.\r\nCrosscheck your scripts and results. If you have calculated data/processed maps, make a plot and check for consistency. E.g. there should be no data outliers, terrestrial species should not occur in the sea etc. If results are valid, mark it as a milestone in your project documentation.\r\nBe aware: if you want to change the coordinate reference system (CRS) you have to transform / project the data. Never just specify a new one, because this doesn’t change the CRS!\r\nAlways include the Coordinate Reference System as EPSG code (e.g. 4326 for log/lat WGS84 Coordinates) at the end of a file name, e.g. my_env_variable_4326.gpkg.\r\nPlease save all your geo data into geopackage files (.gpkg) format to save and process your data.

Our research is focused on understanding ecological dynamics in space and time, at different levels of organisation, from individuals to communities, and across gradients of human altered environments.\r\nWe investigate how fitness consequences of processes acting at the individual level, such as social behaviour or movements, competition, predator-prey or host-pathogen interactions, shape population and community dynamics, also at evolutionary scales. To ensure transparency and reproducibility, we follow the FAIR principles and provide code and data of published papers in our GitHub repositories.\r\n→ Follow us on Bluesky and GitHub.\r\n\r\nOur Vision\r\n\r\nOur ultimate goal is to predict the future viability of wildlife populations, species, and communities faced with accelerating environmental change in the anthropocene and to improve landscape scale planning for conservation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Mission\r\n\r\nWe advance theory and concepts in ecology and evolution as well as the use of computational toolkits by developing and using a wide range of modern field and lab techniques and dynamic and simulation modeling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Teams\r\n\r\nWe are organized in three teams spanning all levels from individuals to populations to communities.

Although effects of beaver activity on several taxa were studied, our understanding of their effects on amphibian assemblages is still incomplete. Especially little is understood how effects of beaver activity on amphibians may be moderated by the gradient of anthropogenic disturbance (represented by human population density). However, such knowledge is important in our human-dominated world. In this study we will sample amphibian diversity (both compositional and functional) along the gradient of human population density, in ponds with and without beavers. The study will take place in North Rhine-Westfalia, in Eifel region, where beaver presence is monitored along the gradient of human population density over several decades.\r\nProfile: interest in community and functional ecology, previous field work experience is an advantage, driver’s license, basic knowledge of R\r\nSupervisors: Viktoriia Radchuk radchuk@izw-berlin.de, Lutz Dalbeck, Stephanie Kramer-Schadt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nM.Sc. Marius Grabow/ Dr. Conny Landgraf\r\n(contact grabow[at]izw-berlin.de or landgraf[at]izw-berlin.de)\r\nGeneral background\r\nParasites are ubiquitous, shaping host traits and behaviours such as movement. While parasite dynamics and host movements are often studied at large scales, e.g. migratory behaviour, our knowledge of the implications at fine scales, e.g. local movements during breeding, remains scarce. We hypothesize that parasites are proximate drivers of individual movement decisions, altering the way hosts allocate their energy, and ultimately influencing foraging, competition and fitness.\r\nThe overarching project aims to understand how fitness consequences of parasites are reflected by individual movement decisions and the surrounding environment. By accounting for a broad range of parasites, high resolution animal movement data and individual trait measures of passerines (swallows and starlings) we follow an integrative approach to model effects of host–parasite interactions in agricultural landscapes.\r\nFeather degrading bacteria (FDB)\r\nFDB are a group of bacteria with the ability to to degrade β-keratin, the principal building block of feathers, imposing substantial selection pressures on host plumage. These bacterial species colonize the plumage of most wild birds with ground-foraging and water birds having a higher prevalence. Although there is no experimental evidence about a direct link between FDB and changes in feather condition in free-living birds, we hypothesize that reduced feather quality associated with higher FDB load might affect flight performance and thus, movement behaviours in temperate breeding birds. To investigate this we collected feather samples from different passerine species including common starling (Sturnus vulgaris), barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) and house martin (Delichon urbica) at their breeding colonies, which will used to quantify the FDB loads. Additionally, for each bird we have information on individual bird condition (body measures and infection status), breeding behaviour and reproductive success as well as movement data which can be analysed using GLM/ GLMM (optional depending on candidate).\r\nJob description\r\nThe successful applicant will perform classic bacteriological analysis to quantify the total and feather-degrading bacterial loads on feather samples collected from each bird. This involves work under sterile conditions, from handling the samples, extract both free-living and attached microorganisms, dilute the obtained bacterial solutions, prepare bacteriological growth media, weigh the quantity of feather used, to count the visible colony-forming units on each plate. If the candidate is motivated statistical analyses (GLM/ GLMM) can be performed after lab work.\r\nProfile:\r\nEnrolled student (Bachelor / Master) in Biology, Ecology, Veterinary Medicine, etc.\r\nPrevious general/ basic laboratory experience (e.g. pipetting, dilution) and skills in bacteriology (work under sterile conditions, preparing growth media) is advantageous\r\nHigh motivation & sense of responsibility to work in an academic environment\r\nGood knowledge of English\r\nDate/ duration: starting time November 2022 (but flexible), minimum duration 3 month (internship), preferably longer (e.g. Master thesis)\r\nApplications and working environment:\r\nThe position preferably starts on 14.

Um die Auswirkungen des Insektensterbens auf das Konkurrenzverhalten insektivorer Tierarten zu bestimmen, wollen wir Rauch- und Mehlschwalben in insektenarmen Agrarlandschaften besendern und die Bewegungen der Tiere mit der lokalen Abundanz und Diversität der Insekten in Zusammenhang bringen.

Mit dieser Methode wollen wir die Insektendiversität und –abundanz in den unterschiedlichen Luftschichten quantifizieren und diese mit den Flugpfaden der Schwalben korrelieren.

      "contents": "\r\n(contact radchuk[at]izw-berlin.de)\r\nAssessing demographic resilience is crucial to assist the conservation of populations and species. A recently proposed method to quantify demographic resilience is based on using average population matrices over time to calculate a single demographic resilience metric. This neglects the fact that the resilience of a population may change over time and is driven by population responses to disturbances, which may also change over time. We will use the COMADRE database to assess demographic resilience of many animal species by considering time explicitly and compare this measure to a single demographic resilience metric calculated over the whole period. The results will be of high importance for revealing the factors affecting demographic resilience and, in turn, for designing appropriate management measures.\r\nProfile: interest in population ecology, basic knowledge of R\r\nSupervisors: Viktoriia Radchuk radchuk@izw-berlin.de, Stephanie Kramer-Schadt, Oliver Höner, Sarah Benhaiem\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\n(contact radchuk[at]izw-berlin.de)\r\nAlthough population cycles received much research interest, we still poorly understand how the demographic structure of the population, i.e. sex ratio and age structure, are changing along the cycle. This is partly because in rodents, which became models for studying population cycles, the field data are typically collected at the coarse yearly resolution. Another question that remains unanswered is whether the dynamics of demographic structure contributes to the emergence of population cycles, or, the other way around, demographic structure is changing because of the population cycling. To address these research gaps we are using a previously developed agent-based model that depicts the mechanisms of predator-prey population dynamics at fine weekly temporal resolution. This model allows obtaining both population abundance and demographic data (sex, age, reproductive state) at a weekly resolution. We will analyse these data with the advanced methods in time series analyses to answer our research questions.\r\nProfile: interest in population ecology, good command of R\r\nSupervisors: Viktoriia Radchuk radchuk@izw-berlin.de, Stephanie Kramer-Schadt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

These are hosted within one repository, so that data can be shared between the single course blocks The course has a strong focus on ecological data analysis and modelling, especially spatio-temporal data of animals. It covers the whole pipeline from observation and sampling → data analysis → model prediction → conservation concept.\r\nCourse pipelineThe single course blocks follow a logical order. The first two introductory courses give an overview over handling data in R. These two course blocks are mandatory for all other courses; we then introduce statistical analyses for various types of data, e.g. from spatial distribution models for single species via biodiversity analyses of community counts, towards analyses of population trends. To do the courses, please follow the code step by step in the respective html-files of each course (see below).\r\n\r\nEach year, we teach a block course (in March) held in English, which comprises 6 ECTS (approx. 180 hrs, of which 60 hrs are preparation, 60 hrs are in presence, and 60 hrs are for preparing a project which will be graded). We will lecture the steps in data analysis, and you will prepare a little spatial conservation concept with data we provide; you are welcome to bring your own data. Drop us a line if you are interested in joining ( assist6[at]izw-berlin.de ).\r\n\r\nCourse announcements\r\nCourses take place in March. Please contact kramer[at]izw-berlin.de\r\nPrior steps\r\nProgram installation\r\nRStudio Desktop (https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) \r\ncurrent R-version (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) \r\nRTools (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) or you are using the {installr} package by following the examples (https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/installr/html/install.Rtools.html) \r\nIf you are not familiar with R and RStudio, open RStudio and follow the steps shown here of how to write scripts in R: Intro to RStudio\r\n\r\nIf you are familiar with scripting in R in RStudio, here is Cedric’s tip of the day of a cool feature in RStudio: use the rainbow parentheses option. For this, go to Tools → Global Options → Code →Display: tick rainbow parentheses. It helps you visually with closing brackets correctly for function calls and loops.\r\nChange decimal separator\r\n…from comma to point in your computer settings if you are working from a German PC, e.g. in Windows → Settings → Time and Region → Region → Advanced Settings → decimal separator: change here to point.\r\nDownload course\r\nSimply copy our course github repository directly here. This will download the whole folder structure with some basic data. However, we still recommend that you make a copy of the R-scripts so that you can write your own comments and code into the scripts. \r\nWe chose the following folder structure for our courses:\r\n\r\n└── d6_teaching_collection                 # root folder \r\n    ├──  data                              # data folder\r\n    │    └── data_borneo                   # e.g., the Borneo data\r\n    │        ├── geo_raster_current_asc    # geo data, raster ascii format, as in data_borneo\r\n    │        └── animal_data               # animal observation data in borneo\r\n    ├── output                             # storage for files created during course\r\n    ├── R                                  # store here all your scripts, i.e.\r\n    │   ├── script_course1.R               # r-files or rmd-files with codes\r\n    │   └── script_course2.R\r\n    ├── R_exercises                        # Exercises \r\n    └── d6_teaching_collection.Rproj       # the R-project\r\n\r\n\r\nOptional - use own course folder setup\r\nOptional - use own course folder setup\r\nOnly do this if you haven’t done the prior step of downloading the whole course and want to set up your own course folder structure or download only a part of the course. In order to ease access to data and script-functionality, we recommend that you use a similar folder structure as we do (see above). You will find the github repository here: https://github.com/EcoDynIZW/d6_teaching_collection.\r\nIf you are familiar with R and want to do the steps ‘by hand’, create a main (root) folder named d6_teaching_collection, then create the subfolders (data, output, R) relative to this root-folder (= d6_teaching_collection). Create an R-project within this folder (e.g. d6_teaching_collection.Rproj. For this, open RStudio → File → New Project → Existing directory: and then link it with the root folder).\r\n\r\nUsers familiar with R and RMarkdown could directly implement our d6 workflow package to make project setups easier and to handle code and projects in a reproducible way. If you chose this option, please read the ReadMe that appears on the github website and install the d6 package (with the options github= FALSE). This has the advantage that you have automatically created a root directory and an R-project. You can then load the data (e.g. data_borneo, provided in zip-files, see below) directly under the root directory. In the d6-package there are already start-rmd-scripts (= RMarkdown-scripts with yaml header → open and execute with the symbol knitR), which make the start easier. But you can also create your own R-scripts, e.g. a new script for each course unit, which you put into the folder R.\r\n\r\nFor both options, a) and b), you would need to download the data separately (link to zip.file below)\r\n\r\nFollow the courses\r\n…when you have downloaded the course folder repository (see above). In the respective course R folder, you will find html-files and rmd-files. Open the html-file in a browser by double-clicking. Open RStudio in parallel by double-clicking on the d6_teaching_collection.Rproj-file. Under Files (lower right window pane) , you can open the R-scripts.\r\n\r\nThen, either create your own R-script and follow the steps in the html-file (you can copy-paste the commands from the html-file), or save a copy of the rmd-file under your own name and run the code chunks step by step in the RStudio console. But you should always have the html-file opened in parallel to RStudio. Each course comes with exercises as a learning control.\r\nCourses 1 and 2: Basic concepts in R & Spatial R\r\n\r\nThese courses contain the minimum knowledge for handling, manipulating and visualizing various data types in R (Course1: vectors, data.frames, lists; Course2: spatial data like raster and vector files). The second course builds on the concepts introduced in course 1. It is therefore recommended to start with Course 1.\r\n\r\nYou can run Course 1 without downloading any additional data. Please note that course 1 is not meant as a beginners course - a lot of great in-depth courses are available online (see links provided in Course 1). Course 1 is rather a ‘refresher’ of the basic R concepts that are needed for all subsequent courses. In a nutshell, it goes through the base R cheatsheet. It is recommended to have the cheatsheet downloaded and to make your own notes into a copy of our script. You will find the course material for Course 1 in the repository under ./R/Course1_R_Intro.\r\n\r\nFor Course 2, you need to have the repository downloaded for access to the spatial data. Please open the .html file in ./R/Course2_R_Spatial.\r\n\r\nCourses 3_a and 3_b Species distribution models\r\n\r\nIn these courses, you will learn how to establish a functional relationship between the (relative) occurrence probability of species and (environmental) variables. This functional relationship – or species distribution/ occupancy model – can be extrapolated to other similar areas and used as an assessment of the availability of potentially suitable habitat for the respective species.\r\npresence only / MaxEnt\r\nPlease download MaxEnt here: https://biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/open_source/maxent/\r\nFor MaxEnt you may still need to install a Java version. If you double-click the file maxent.jar, an interface should appear.\r\n\r\nDownload course data: For conducting course 3, we will provide you with additional data. Drag and drop the folders “data_borneo” and “data_berlin” from the provided zip files into the main folder (here: d6_teaching_collection).\r\n\r\nLink to data_borneo and data_berlin will be provided.\r\nPlease open the .html file in ./R/Course3_a_presence_only_sdm.\r\nrepeated presence absence / occupancy models\r\nPlease open the .html file in ./R/Course3_b_presence_absence_occupancy.\r\n\r\nCourse 4 Movement analysis\r\n\r\nThis course is an overview over the first steps for analysing relocation (telemetry) data. Using our collared red fox (Vulpes vulpes) ‘Q von Stralau’ as an example of movement data with fixes every 4 minutes, we will show how to clean your data and make first analyses of the tracks (step length, turning angles) and home range analyses.\r\nPlease open the .html file in ./R/Course4_telemetry_movement.\r\n\r\nCourse 5 Biodiversity metrics\r\n\r\nIn this part of the course we are going to explore more in detail how we measure and compare biodiversity among different sites. We will focus mainly of alpha diversity, which refers to the diversity at a specific site; this is the group of metrics we use to compare diversity among sites. We will explore the classic and current alpha diversity indices for both presence/absence data and abundance data. Then, we will learn which conditions the diversity samples need to meet to be comparable and how to analyse the effects of environmental variables in the diversity metric values. Finally, we will apply all this to statistically analyse urban Berlin bird diversity and create a spatial “map of diversity” for the city.\r\nPlease open the .html file in ./R/Course5_biodiversity_abundance_metrics.\r\n\r\nCourse 6 Population analyses\r\n\r\nPlease open the .html file in ./R/Course6_demography_population_models.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We study how these anthropogenic drivers impact the distribution and abundance of ground dwelling mammals. In our field projects we use camera-traps and environmental DNA (eDNA) and invertebrate-derived DNA (iDNA) metabarcoding to assess species occurrences and we employ statistical models that investigate how anthropogenic drivers affect species distribution. We develop standardized methods and strategies for rigorous biodiversity assessments in order to provide robust scientific baseline data that allow monitoring species-specific and community-wide trends over time.

Since 2008, we have monitored mammalian communities over time in forest sites in various stages of recovering from severe logging impacts and under different forest management strategies.

In addition to habitat loss, unsustainable hunting is emerging as an increasingly important threat to tropical wildlife biodiversity. Due to pervasive hunting even many protected areas face massive species losses today. This widespread defaunation has been particularly severe in Indochina, where ‘industrial’ snaring has decimated wildlife populations drastically and driven many species to local extinction. Since 2014 we have implemented systematic camera-trapping and iDNA surveys across protected and non-protected areas within the Annamite ecoregion. Using modern species distribution models we aim to identify and predict areas of particular conservation concern in order to support better conservation efforts by our partners.\r\nFinancial support: Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), Point Defiance Zoo & Aquaria, National Geographic, Ocean Park Conservation Foundation, Manfred-Hermsen-Stiftung, Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund, Eva Mayr-Stihl Stiftung\r\n\r\nKey Publications:\r\n\r\nTilker et al. (2020) DIVERS DISTRIB\r\n\r\n\r\nNguyen et al. (2019) NAT ECOL EVOL\r\n\r\n\r\nTilker et al. (2019) COMMS BIOL\r\n\r\n\r\nTilker et al. (2017) SCIENCE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConcepts & Methodology\r\n\r\nHierarchical statistical modeling for wildlife research.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople involved: Ana Sanz, Jürgen Niedballa\r\nCollaborators: Prof. Dr. Beth Gardner and many others, depending on specific projects\r\nWildlife survey data are fraught with challenges: often sparse, spatially and/or temporally limited or biased due to logistic constraints, and imperfectly reflecting ecological states and processes due to imperfect detection (i.e., failing to observe species or individuals even though they are present). Hierarchical statistical modeling has emerged as the prime tool to deal with these challenges, by describing separate sub-models for the underlying ecological and the detection process. We employ such models throughout our research projects. But we also modify existing and develop new hierarchical models, and make these more accessible to end users, to improve our ability to study, monitor, and ultimately, protect wildlife. Modeling approaches we work with range from occupancy models for species occurrence to N-mixture, distance sampling and other count-based models for species abundance and population dynamics, to traditional and spatial capture-recapture models for abundance, density and demographics.\r\n\r\nKey Publications:\r\n\r\nKe et al. (2022) ECOL APPL\r\n\r\n\r\nSollmann et al. (2021) ECOL APPL\r\n\r\n\r\nGardner et al. (2018) ECOL EVOL\r\n\r\n\r\nSollmann et al. (2016) MEE\r\n\r\n\r\nRoyle et al. (2014) Spatial Capture Recapture.

      "contents": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWelcome! We study the behaviour, ecology and health of three clans of spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) in the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania since 1987. We are currently interested in the impact of early life conditions, infections and human activities on individual performance and fitness at all life stages. With our collaborators we also study the role of epigenetic mechanisms in mediating the effects of the social environment on life history trade-offs, hormones and immunity, and the demographic consequences of disturbances. Our interdisciplinary research applies non-invasive or minimally invasive methods and to further this aim we have developed and verified several faecal assays for spotted hyenas.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure: M. Gicquel (from Gicquel et al. 2022 Ecosphere)Why are spotted hyenas so interesting to study?\r\nThis highly social mammal has several unusual traits: female social dominance, an erectile ‘pseudopenis’ in females (similar to that of the male penis), an exceptionally long lactation period and intense sibling competing. It is a keystone carnivore in the ecosystem, which both hunts and scavenges. All these aspects make hyenas an interesting model species to study social behaviour, sexual conflict, maternal effects, host-pathogen interactions, immunology or endocrinology.\r\nOur study population experiences extreme and unpredictable fluctuations in prey abundance throughout the year, because of the migratory movements of its main prey (wildebeest, zebras and Thompson’s gazelles) and the low abundance of resident herbivores. We discovered that Serengeti hyenas solve this problem by commuting long distances to forage throughout the year. Individuals leave their clan territory and travel to areas up to 70 km to locate areas with large aggregations of migratory herbivores where they feed before returning to their clan territory. In the context of global change, the commuting system of Serengeti hyenas is particularly valuable to study how animals cope with a variable and uncertain resource.\r\nUnfortunately, commuting hyenas in the Serengeti can get killed by wire snares set illegally by bushmeat hunters along some borders of the Park or become victims of road accidents. These anthropogenic threats are likely to intensify with the expected increases in local human populations and traffic volume associated with tourism. Changes in rainfall patterns driven by global warming may also have cascading effects on this large slow-reproducing mammal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRunning Projects\r\n\r\nBehavioural Ecology, Ecology, and Demography\r\n\r\nEcological, social and maternal effects on individual performance, population dynamics and resilience\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent team & collaborators: Morgane Gicquel, Dagmar Thierer, Stephan Karl, Sonja Metzger, Sarah Benhaiem, Marion L.
