Our research is focused on understanding ecological dynamics in space and time, at different levels of organisation, from individuals to communities, and across gradients of human altered environments. We investigate how fitness consequences of processes acting at the individual level, such as social behaviour or movements, competition, predator-prey or host-pathogen interactions, shape population and community dynamics, also at evolutionary scales.\r\n\r\nHow to contact us?\r\nEmail: assist6[at]izw-berlin.de\r\nAddress:\r\nLeibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research\r\nDepartment of Ecological Dynamics\r\nAlfred-Kowalke-Str. 17\r\nD-10315 Berlin, Germany\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{\"x\":{\"options\":{\"crs\":{\"crsClass\":\"L.CRS.EPSG3857\",\"code\":null,\"proj4def\":null,\"projectedBounds\":null,\"options\":{}}},\"setView\":[[52.5062,13.5211],14,[]],\"calls\":[{\"method\":\"addProviderTiles\",\"args\":[\"CartoDB.Voyager\",null,\"Default Map\",{\"errorTileUrl\":\"\",\"noWrap\":false,\"detectRetina\":false}]},{\"method\":\"addProviderTiles\",\"args\":[\"Stamen.Terrain\",null,\"Terrain Map\",{\"errorTileUrl\":\"\",\"noWrap\":false,\"detectRetina\":false}]},{\"method\":\"addProviderTiles\",\"args\":[\"CartoDB.DarkMatter\",null,\"Dark Map\",{\"errorTileUrl\":\"\",\"noWrap\":false,\"detectRetina\":false}]},{\"method\":\"addTiles\",\"args\":[\"//{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\",null,\"OpenStreetMap\",{\"minZoom\":0,\"maxZoom\":18,\"tileSize\":256,\"subdomains\":\"abc\",\"errorTileUrl\":\"\",\"tms\":false,\"noWrap\":false,\"zoomOffset\":0,\"zoomReverse\":false,\"opacity\":1,\"zIndex\":1,\"detectRetina\":false,\"attribution\":\"&copy; <a href=\\\"http://openstreetmap.org\\\">OpenStreetMap<\\/a> contributors, <a href=\\\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\\\">CC-BY-SA<\\/a>\"}]},{\"method\":\"addPopups\",\"args\":[52.506286189884,13.5211671539743,\"<b>Leibniz Institute for<br>Zoo and Wildlife Research<\\/b>\",null,null,{\"maxWidth\":300,\"minWidth\":50,\"autoPan\":true,\"keepInView\":false,\"closeButton\":false,\"className\":\"\"}]},{\"method\":\"addLayersControl\",\"args\":[[\"Default Map\",\"Terrain Map\",\"Dark Map\",\"OpenStreetMap\"],[],{\"collapsed\":false,\"autoZIndex\":true,\"position\":\"topright\"}]}],\"limits\":{\"lat\":[52.506286189884,52.506286189884],\"lng\":[13.5211671539743,13.5211671539743]}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nGeneral Information\r\nThe department is composed of three teams on (1) Individual Dynamics, (2) Population Dynamics and (3) Biodiversity Dynamics.\r\nStephanie Kramer-Schadt is the department head and leader of the Population Dynamics team. Conny Landgraf is the assistant of the department head; she can assist with administrative duties (e.g. contracts, travel sheets, etc.). Moritz Wenzler and Jan Axtner are responsible for data management, data storage and the working group’s R code collection. As each department member has a specific area of expertise, we created an expert list (see 1.3) if you need help on specific topics. PhD students and scientists are obliged to update this expert list with their own skills and responsibilities as well.\r\nFor information on the Department, check our webpage or subscribe to our Twitter account (@EcoDynIZW) for news about papers, helpful R-code, courses or scientific positions.\r\nTeams of the Department of Ecological Dynamics:\r\nIndividual Dynamics – PI: Sarah Benhaiem\r\nPopulation Dynamics – PI: Stephanie Kramer-Schadt & Viktoriia Radchuk\r\nBiodiversity Dynamics – PI: Andreas Wilting\r\nAdministrative support\r\nConny Landgraf\r\nTel: - 466\r\nEmail: assist6[at]izw-berlin.de or landgraf[at]izw-berlin.de\r\nData Managers\r\nDr. Jan Axtner\r\nTel: - 339\r\nEmail: axtner[at]izw-berlin.de\r\nMoritz Wenzler-Meya\r\nTel: - 722\r\nEmail: wenzler[at]izw-berlin.de\r\nIn-house experts / scientists / responsibilities\r\nWho does what in the department? Tasks and expertise as well as meeting dates and protocols can be found here: U:\\GUEST\\Abteilung6\\GeneralInfo\r\nConducting BSc/MSc/PhD Projects\r\nFor PhD students: please read the IZW PhD guidelines (\\\\izw-daten-8\\Alle\\GUEST\\Doktorand(inn)en\\IZW-PhD-rules) carefully and follow the instructions (e.g. when you have to give an introduction talk). For any question about these guidelines, contact the PhD coordinators (currently: Gábor Czirják (czirjak[at]izw-berlin.de) and Sarah Benhaiem (benhaiem[at]izw-berlin.de)).\r\nMeetings\r\nRegular meetings with your supervisor often help to avoid a waste of time (see also Appendix C). It is in the responsibility of the student to organize and schedule regular meeting with his/ her supervisor or the team.\r\nYou can either arrange a fixed date with your supervisor (e.g. first Monday of every month) or schedule them on demand. Please find an agreement with your supervisor how to handle this best. Please keep in mind that any non-regular meeting should be planned at least two weeks ahead.\r\nUse the IZW outlook calendar to schedule meetings with supervisors and colleagues (if you have an IZW Email address). That is: create the entry in the calendar and ‘invite’ the others, so that the date/ location appears in each calendar, with sufficient notice time for the automated reminder (i.e. 1 day/ 1 hr).\r\nPrepare the meetings: Think carefully about your problems/questions and write your agenda (what you want to discuss) before the meeting, make suggestions for your solution(s) and ask the supervisors/collaborators to comment on your solution(s).\r\nWrite the minutes of the meeting and save it in the project folder (we give instructions about this project folder below 3.1.). Minimum information needed: (1) date of meeting, (2) name of participants, (3) questions or problems discussed, (4) main solutions suggested and (5) aims or results to prepare for the next meeting. Write down agreements of the responsibilities of all collaborators.\r\nPresent your project progress regularly in the department meetings, also to get feedback and discuss problems you ran into.\r\nThesis writing\r\nStart writing the thesis early enough. Write simple and concise sentences based on what is known in the literature. Join a ‘pub club’ (i.e. retreats for writing), e.g. Team 2 has regular meetings on jointly discussing drafts of each other. Please also read the instructions (Under construction) for how to write good scientific papers.\r\nArrange with your supervisor how and in what form you report progress. Getting regular feedback for chapters or even just paragraphs might keep you from running into dead ends. When asking for revisions plan in sufficient time for the reviewers to read and respond (1-3 weeks, depending on the amount of text).\r\nFor PhD students: A first complete manuscript draft should be ready after ~ 1 year after starting time.\r\nSend the final version of your manuscript/thesis to all supervisors/colleagues at least 4 weeks before the submission date and keep in mind that you might have to revise it.\r\nOrganizing Workflows\r\nTo store data and results, the IZW follows the DFG-guidelines for good scientific practice. In our department, we often use “scripting” (written code of different programming languages) to process and analyze data, and make results reproducible. Work is structured and organized in projects and each project will get a project ID from the data administrators of the department. We consider a project to be a self-contained topic, e.g. analyses for a manuscript, thesis chapter, etc. For each project a separate folder is created and all relevant scripts, results, the lab-book, documents, literature, minutes of meetings etc. related to this project are to be kept in that main folder. For documents (not for scripts!) use your surname, type of document, project name and in the end the date (YYYYMMDD) as version numbers for file names (kramer_manuscript_lynxibm_20201231.docx) and do not use names like doc_final.docx, doc_finalfinal.docx, doc_lastversion.docx etc. It should contain all information needed to repeat the study and conduct follow-up studies. Whenever possible use the standardized project/folder structure shown in section 3.1. Each project or subproject should have a concise but meaningfully electronic lab-book (see section X.Z) that allows to follow the workflow and the decisions made in it.\r\nProject workflow\r\nContact the Data Managers (Jan or Moritz) of the respective teams to organize your project ID, get server access and how to arrange your workspace best. To setup a project folder, we ask you to follow the setup:\r\nThe standardized project folder outline! (see Appendix A) cf. d6 R package and GitHub)\r\nMake an outline of the structure separately in your electronic lab-book (see 3.3.1), to indicate what to find in each folder and keep it updated.\r\nPlease hand over the raw data to the data manager before starting your project analysis, to avoid accidental data losses.\r\nStore the raw data, e.g. data from field work, in the folder named data-raw. Use a folder named output to store data created from the raw data (e.g. after data cleaning or editing). This should also be the place where the master table is located, i.e. the dataset of all subsequent analyses. If needed you can have a temporary subfolder in the “output” folder for everyday work and analysis trials. Empty the temporary folder regularly. Plots and figures should be stored in the plots folder. Scripts should be stored in the R folder. Documents like manuscripts, proposals, etc. should be stored in the docs folder. Save important, computational or labour intensive interim results or final results. Use appropriate subfolders such as interim-results_<date> or final-results_<date>.\r\nReproducibility\r\nTo ensure reproducibility and for your own sake always try to script your work! If possible use R, Python, SQL, etc. for analyses and avoid manual / mouse commands (e.g. ‘clicking’ in ArcGIS, QGIS etc.). If you cannot use scripts, use tools such as the model-builder in ArcGIS or QGIS and save the drag & drop model builder scripts.\r\nDocumentation\r\nProject documentation is not a final task, but an ongoing process starting from day one. DFG guidelines for Safeguarding and Storing of Primary Data states ‘Primary data as the basis for publications shall be securely stored for ten years in a durable form in the institution of their origin.’ Hence, at the end of a research project, you have to hand over a single well-documented folder per project (usually a paper on the respective subject, or the BSc thesis) along with all original data. The project folder should contain all project related documents and data (e.g. simulation model codes, simulation results, scripts for statistical analysis, scripts for tables and figures, manuscripts, important work documents, applications, permits, reports, etc.) as well as a the final version of a thesis or paper. Unfinished work (data from conducted experiments that were not analyzed or published) should contain the above documents as far as possible, including a very detailed method description. For the ease of documentation effort please follow the section (3.3.1).\r\nElectronic lab-book\r\nAt the start of each new project, create an electronic lab-book to document your workflow and decisions therein. It is of major importance that you keep this lab-book updated. For the ease of use we recommend simple .doc files (MS Word, Libre Office etc.) to keep record of our work. Write down important thoughts, things you have tried, also failed experiments. Try to use clear and comprehensible notes. Although this generates some additional effort you will realize soon that it will help you and others to track your work and make it reproducible. We highly recommend to use GitHub as version control of your project. You have to connect your GitHub account to the EcoDynIZW organization on GitHub to share code with colleagues. Please create repositories on the EcoDynIZW account and not on your private account! It is mandatory to hand over the electronic lab-book to the institute as part of the ‘Safeguarding and Storing of Primary Data’ regulation of the German Research Council DFG after finishing your project. To document scripting we recommend to use R Markdown (.rmd) files if possible. Between your code chunks you should annotate the script with everything that is necessary to understand and follow the code. Additionally, if you push new code to GitHub for version control, you have to comment on your committed code as well. It may be necessary to have an additional word document.\r\nScripting\r\nGeneral recommendations\r\nWrite the author, name and date in a header (you can use the d6 package templates for this as well).\r\nKeep code in scripts as concise as possible.\r\nUse in-line comments to explain your code that others can follow your code.\r\nIf possible, use dynamic paths (i.e. see R-package here.\r\nAlways set variables/ parameters at the top of your script; do not set values somewhere inside the code as this is error prone, because these values tend to be forgotten to get changed when updating a script. The same applies to loading packages. Please also make sure to only load packages that are really needed and remove those that you are not using for the final analysis.\r\nSave the output of a script as .rds file to smoothly load it in the next script. Additionally, save the output in a file format usable beyond R, e.g. use .csv or .txt if you want to save tabular data or GeoTiff if you want to save a raster map.\r\nUse separate scripts to create figures of publishable quality (700 dpi) from the results. Use a vector graphics format like pdf.\r\nFor simulation studies: Include all scripts, e.g. additional model code, batch files with simulated parameters, simulated landscapes and simulation results, and files used for the analyses.\r\nR\r\nStick to the Rstudio style guide to ensure readability of code.\r\nWe recommend using R-Studio projects and R Markdown documents when scripting in R. If you use another “integrated development environment” (IDE) make sure you can provide versioned plain R scripts using a relative path to the used data files.\r\nImplement version control by using GitHub. If you install packages or use scripts and code chunks from GitHub provided by others, be aware to acknowledge the code developer prior to publication of scripts.\r\nDo not save the R history or the R environment. Always start a fresh and an empty R session to avoid artifacts by using objects of functions that were not defined in your script. More details here: https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/.\r\nIf possible use log files to document messages and errors.\r\nPython\r\nIn general we recommend using Jupyter notebooks. [under construction]\r\nNetlogo\r\n[under construction]\r\nQGIS\r\nIn general we recommend doing GIS analyses in R. If you have to use QGIS use Python as scripting language. However, the RQGIS package provides a great opportunity to script complete workflows in QGIS by using R. Moreover, you can include R scripts in the QGIS toolbox.\r\n[under construction]\r\nSpatial Data\r\nIf you are working with spatial data please have the following in mind:\r\nAlways check the projection (cartographic reference system (CRS)) of your data. Depending on what you want to do it could be necessary to change the CRS system, i.e. from an angular unit (like GPS data) to a projected unit in meters. BUT sometimes you cannot easily change it or it will drastically change your data.\r\nIf you want to save you spatial data, please save it as Geopackage (.gpkg) or raster data GeoTiff (.tif). Please give a clear name, document the filename in your lab book and add the EPSG code of your CRS to the file name. Always use utf-8 as file encoding.\r\nIf you are not sure how to handle your spatial data please contact Moritz Wenzler, the GIS manager, for help.\r\nFor detailed information about Spatial data go to Appendix B).\r\nBackup\r\nImportant: backup your work! Make copies of raw data/files and scripts and save it in another location if you work on private computers. PhD students should work on the M-drive or the U-drive, never directly on the C-drive of the computer.\r\nManuscript Submissions/Revisions\r\nWhen you are submitting a manuscript create a copy of the related subproject folder and add a suffix submission_1_<JournalAbbreviation>. This copy shall be stored and never changed (we recommend to zip this folder)! When conducting a revisions or resubmission, copy the folder to submission_2_<JournalAbbreviation> and revise the paper.\r\nPlease find additional information on ‘how to write a scientific paper’, how to avoid statistical pitfalls or how to organize workflows here: U:\\GUEST\\Abteilung6\\LabGuidlines\\D6_Lab_Guidelines_SupplementsToRead, or on request.\r\nAppendix A) Folder Structure for Project Folders\r\nA new project can be started by installing the d6 R-package. Running new_project() with a unique and descriptive name for your project (see below) will create a full scaffolding structure for all your future analysis steps. If you like, you can also specify a path and the project will be created there.\r\nPlease create repositories on the EcoDynIZW account and not on your private account!\r\nRoot project folder\r\nName it like:\r\nspecies|topic_country|simu_method|approach_surname_firstletterofgivenname\r\ne.g. unicornus_wl_sdm_smith_j (unicornus project in wonderland, species distribution model from John Smith) or stability_simu_rpackage_smith_j\r\nEverything should be written in small letters.\r\nAvoid spaces or hyphen in the path to the file.\r\nSpecies name should be in latin and please use your surname and the first letter of your given name at the end.\r\nCountry should be the international abbreviation.\r\nThe root project folder should hold:\r\nR_Project_file: your main file for your R project (if used) — do not confuse this with R-scripts!\r\nWe highly recommend to use R, but if it is necessary to use another programming language and/or program please use the same structure as described in the following:\r\n\r\ndata-raw: A folder that contains the complete raw dataset (e.g. telemetry data, experiment results, electrophoresis images, vegetation survey plots, species lists, etc.).\r\nDo not use MS Excel files use .csv or .txt files to store/ save data.\r\nMetadata belonging to the raw data should be provided in a separate file but it should be given the same name with an additional suffix as the raw data file, e.g. area1_specieslist.txt or area1_specieslist_metadata.txt\r\n\r\ndocs: A folder that contains anything related with project administration e.g. applications, permits, grants, timeline, research proposal, the electronic lab-book.\r\noutput: A folder that contains processed raw data\r\nResults of data preparation and wrangling\r\nResults of spatial data processing and spatial analysis, e.g. rasterizing, extracting, calculating on the basic layer and the resulting map used for analyses.\r\nFinal results from analyses\r\n\r\nplots: A folder that contains all produced images for the data exploration, presentations, and publications.\r\nR: A folder that contains all scripts that are used within the project.\r\nIf you need additional subfolders add them. Please use also second-level subfolders inside the subfolders to keep a clear and tidy structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Common project folder strucuture used in the Department of Ecological Dynamics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix B) Detailed Spatial Data Information\r\nWhen using spatial data give clear names for maps ≤ 13 characters without special characters or spaces.\r\nWrite down the cartographic reference system (CRS) at the end of the file name, e.g. filename_4326.\r\nAlways use utf-8 encoding, NEVER use the system setting. If you have to use different character encoding settings, then name the used encoding in the filename.\r\nSave the data as geopackage (.gpkg, recommended but cannot be used via ArcGis) or shapefile. Geopackages should be the first choice as the format is much quicker in every task (loading, saving, changing and computing), less limited and OGC-Standard (Open Geospatial Consortium). Be aware, that shapefiles have many limitations e.g. max 7 characters for column names. Further information is listed in Appendix B.\r\nCrosscheck your scripts and results. If you have calculated data/processed maps, make a plot and check for consistency. E.g. there should be no data outliers, terrestrial species should not occur in the sea etc. If results are valid, mark it as a milestone in your project documentation.\r\nBe aware: if you want to change the coordinate reference system (CRS) you have to transform / project the data. Never just specify a new one, because this doesn’t change the CRS!\r\nAlways include the Coordinate Reference System as EPSG code (e.g. 4326 for log/lat WGS84 Coordinates) at the end of a file name, e.g. my_env_variable_4326.gpkg.\r\nPlease save all your geo data into geopackage files (.gpkg) format to save and process your data. In general, if you export data from R please save it as an R Studio file (.rds). It will be saved without any losses.\r\nStore all point/line/polygon data as WGS84 (EPSG 4326).\r\nIf you do not understand this paragraph, contact the geodata-manager (Moritz Wenzler) before doing anything involving geodata.\r\nAppendix C) What Nature Says…\r\nNature 561, 277 (2018)\r\nWhy you need an agenda for meetings with your principal investigator\r\nA list of talking points can help with navigating potentially difficult topics and sticky negotiations. As PhD students, we often find ourselves discussing our interactions with our principal investigators (PIs) and swapping advice for improving our mentoring meetings. We have found three practices to be consistently helpful: asking our PIs about all aspects of their job; preparing an agenda for each meeting; and negotiating new experiments without explicitly saying ‘no’.\r\nRead the full text: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-018-06619-3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nWelcome to D6!\r\n\r\n We are scientists of the Department of Ecological Dynamics at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Berlin, Germany. Our research is focused on understanding ecological dynamics in space and time, at different levels of organisation, from individuals to communities, and across gradients of human altered environments. We investigate how fitness consequences of processes acting at the individual level, such as social behaviour or movements, competition, predator-prey or host-pathogen interactions, shape population and community dynamics, also at evolutionary scales. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Vision\r\nOur ultimate goal is to predict the future viability of wildlife populations and species faced with accelerating environmental change in the anthropocene and to improve landscape scale planning for conservation.\r\nOur Mission\r\nBy developing and using a wide range of modern field techniques, lab analytical methods and especially dynamic and simulation modelling, we aim to advance theory and concepts in ecology and evolution, and to promote the development of computational and analytical toolkits.\r\nOur Teams\r\nWe are organized in three teams spanning the different levels of organisation from the individual to the community level.

Although any differences in movement behaviour due to individual characteristics of the host and heterogeneity in landscape structure are likely to have considerable consequences for disease dynamics, these mechanisms are neglected in most epidemiological studies. Therefore, developing a general understanding how the interaction of movement behaviour and spatial heterogeneity shapes host densities, contact rates and ultimately pathogen spread is a key question in ecological and epidemiological research.\r\nIn this project, we have addressed this gap using both theoretical and empirical modelling approaches. In the theoretical part of my thesis, we have investigated bottom-up effects of individual movement behaviour and landscape structure on host density, contact rates, and ultimately disease dynamics. We have extended an established agent-based model that simulates ecological and epidemiological key processes to incorporate explicit movement of host individuals and landscape complexity. In the empirical part, we have focused on the spatiotemporal dynamics of Classical Swine Fever in a wild boar population by analysing epidemiological data that was collected during an outbreak in Northern Germany persisting for eight years.\r\n\r\nDr. Cédric Scherer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

With a nationwide survey I aim to gather information on which animals are perceived as positive, neutral and negative and what humans connect with certain speciesby humans.

      "contents": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Welcome! We study individual and social dynamics principally in African carnivores. Our key long-term research focuses on spotted hyenas in the Serengeti National Park. Research began in 1987 and currently we have detailed information on more than 2500 individually known hyenas. Our interdisciplinary research applies non-invasive and minimally invasive techniques and to further this aim we have developed and verified faecal assays for spotted hyenas. \r\n\r\n<b style=’font-size16px;’Overview of our main research foci and methods:\r\n\r\nWhy focus on spotted hyenas?\r\nThis fascinating species has a set of unique traits including female social dominance, an erectile penile structure in females similar in structure to that of the male penis, high post-natal investment in terms of lactation and facultative siblicide, females that acquire a social position immediately below that held by their mother (rank ‘inheritance’) when they become adult and immigrant males that queue (stand in line) for social status. The spotted hyena is a keystone carnivore in the Serengeti ecosystem and it is both an excellent hunters and scavenger. These aspects make it an ideal model species to study key unresolved questions on a wide range of topics, including social behaviour, sexual conflict, maternal effects, host-pathogen dynamics, endocrinology, immunology and pathogen-host adaptations.\r\nOur study population experiences extreme and unpredictable fluctuations in prey abundance throughout the year, because of the migratory movements of its main prey – wildebeest, zebras and Thompson’s gazelles – and the low abundance of resident herbivores. We discovered that spotted hyenas in the Serengeti National Park solve this problem by ‘commuting’ long distances to forage throughout the year. Individuals leave their clan territory and travel to areas up to 70 km to locate areas contain large aggregations of migratory herbivores where they feed before returning ‘home’ to their clan territory. This commuting system is ideal for testing ideas concerning the effect of prey abundance on various aspects of hyena ecology and behaviour. Furthermore, exceptionally high post-natal maternal investment in terms of lactation and rank related access to food resources make hyenas ideal for research on socially mediated effects of maternal input on offspring survival and other components of fitness.\r\nHuman activities are an important source of mortality spotted hyenas in the Serengeti National Park. Illegal setting of wire snares by bushmeat hunters is extensive along the west and northwest border of the Serengeti National Park. Hyenas in our study population are killed as ‘by-catch’ in these wire snares when they ‘commute’ in areas containing large aggregations of migratory herbivores which are also profitable locations used by illegal bushmeat hunters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This change has direct and indirect effects on wildlife. However, certain species like the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) have adapted to these human dominated habitats very well. But what is the secret of success? With this project I am trying to get one step closer to deciphering the mystery by using an overarching approach that deals with movement ecology, foraging strategies and diseases (parasites and microbiomes) of this successful carnivore.\r\n\r\nDr. Carolin Scholz\r\nHuman perceptions of urban wildlife\r\nUnderstanding human perceptions towards urban wildlife is essential for the development of management instruments. While some species such as wild boar (Sus scrofa) or red fox (Vulpes vulpes) are associated with damage, fear and disease, humans also seek contact with nature and feed animals like squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) and hedgehogs (Erinaceidae). In my PhD project, I investigate the social side of human-wildlife-interactions in urban areas. With a nationwide survey I aim to gather information on which animals are perceived as positive, neutral and negative and what humans connect with certain speciesby humans. Combined with modelling of human-wildlife-interaction zones and expert interviews with forest and greenspace managers, conservation organisations and hunting associations, my aim is to classify measures in terms of greenspace planning, environmental education and population control, which lead to a less conflictive human-wildlife-coexistence.\r\n\r\nSimon Moesch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
