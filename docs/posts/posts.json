Mind also that the development version, being under development,\r\ncan sometimes be broken. So before downloading it make sure that the\r\ncurrent build status is build passing. The current built status is\r\nprovided at the top of this readme document.\r\nAlso, if you access the network via a proxy, you may experience\r\ntroubles with install_github. In such case try something like:\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(httr)\r\nwith_config(use_proxy(\"192.168.2.2:3128\"), devtools::install_github(\"courtiol/IsoriX/IsoriX\"))\r\n\r\n\r\nOff course, unless you are in the same institute than some of us,\r\nreplace the numbers with your proxy settings! Where to learn about\r\nIsoriX?\r\nYou can start by reading our bookdown!\r\nThen, if may not be a bad idea to also have a look at our papers:\r\nhere and there.\r\nAnother great source of help is our mailing list. First register for\r\nfree (using your Google account) and then feel free to send us\r\nquestions.\r\nFor specific help on IsoriX functions and objects, you should also\r\ncheck the documentation embedded in the package:\r\n\r\n\r\nhelp(package = \"IsoriX\")\r\n\r\n\r\nin R after having installed and attached (= loaded) the package. How\r\ncan you contribute?\r\nThere are plenty way you can contribute! If you are fluent in R\r\nprogramming, you can improve the code and develop new functions. If you\r\nare not so fluent, you can still edit the documentation files to make\r\nthem more complete and clearer, write new vignettes, report bugs or make\r\nfeature requests.

To do so, open Rstudio and run the following two lines in the console. In case the {devtools} package is already installed, skip that step.\r\n\r\n\r\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\r\ndevtools::install_github(\"EcoDynIZW/d6\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are asked if you want to update other packages either press “No” (option 3) and continue or update the packages before running the install command again.\r\n\r\nCreate Project Directory\r\nRun the function new_project() to create a new project. This will create a standardized directory with all the scaffolding we use for all projects in our department. It also add several files needed for documentation of your project.\r\nTo start a new project in the current working directory, simply run:\r\n\r\n\r\nd6::new_project(\"unicornus_wl_sdm_smith_j\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease give your project a unique and descriptive name: species_country_topic_name\r\nFor example, when John Smith is developing a species distribution models for unicorns in Wonderland, a descriptive title could be: unicornus_wl_sdm_smith_j. Please use underscores and the international Alpha-2 encoding for countries.\r\nThe main folders created in the root folder (here unicornus_wl_sdm_smith_j) are the following:\r\n\r\n.\r\n└── unicornus_wl_sdm_smith_j\r\n    ├── data-raw\r\n    ├── docs\r\n    ├── output\r\n    ├── plots\r\n    └── R\r\n\r\nThe full scaffolding structure including all subdirectories and additional files looks like this:\r\n\r\n. \r\n└── unicornus_wl_sdm_smith_j\r\n    ├── .Rproj.user         —  Rproject files\r\n    ├── data-raw            —  raw data (tabular data in root folder)\r\n    │    └── geo-raw        —  raw spatial data\r\n    ├── docs                —  documents\r\n    │   ├── admin           —  adminstrative docs, e.g. permits \r\n    │   ├── literature      —  literature used for parameterization + ms\r\n    │   ├── manuscript      —  manuscript drafts (main + supplement)\r\n    │   ├── presentations   —  talks and poster presentations\r\n    │   └── reports         —  rendered reports\r\n    ├── output              —  everything that is computed (except plots)\r\n    │   ├── data-proc       —  processed tabular data\r\n    │   └── geo-proc        —  processed spatial data\r\n    ├── plots               —  plot output\r\n    ├── R                   —  scripts\r\n    │   ├── 00_start.R      —  first script to run\r\n    │   └── XX_submit.R     —  final script to run\r\n    ├── .gitignore          —  contains which files to ignore for version control\r\n    ├── .Rbuildignore       —  contains which files to ignore for package builds\r\n    ├── DESCRIPTION         —  contains project details and package dependencies\r\n    ├── NAMESPACE           —  contains context for R objects\r\n    └── project.Rproj       —  Rproject file: use to start your project\r\n\r\n\r\nUse A Custom Root Directory\r\nYou don’t need to change the working directory first—you can also specify a path to a custom root folder in which the new project folder is created:\r\n\r\n\r\n## both work:\r\nd6::new_project(\"unicornus_wl_sdm_smith_j\", path = \"absolute/path/to/the/root/folder\")\r\n## or:\r\nd6::new_project(\"unicornus_wl_sdm_smith_j\", path = \"absolute/path/to/the/root/folder/\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe resulting final directory of your project would be absolute/path/to/the/root/folder/unicornus_wl_sdm_smith_j.\r\n\r\nUse Version Control\r\nIf you want to create a GitHub repository for the project at the same time, use instead:\r\n\r\n\r\nd6::new_project(\"unicornus_wl_sdm_smith_j\", github = TRUE)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy default, the visibility of the GitHub repository is set to “private” but you can also change that:\r\n\r\n\r\nd6::new_project(\"unicornus_wl_sdm_smith_j\", github = TRUE, private_repo = FALSE)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that to create a GitHub repo you will need to have configured your system as explained here.\r\n\r\nSetup without Geo Directories\r\nIf your project does not (or will not) contain any spatial data, you can prevent the creation of the directories geo-raw and geo-proc by setting geo to FALSE:\r\n\r\n\r\nd6::new_project(\"unicornus_wl_sdm_smith_j\", geo = FALSE)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd Documentation to Your Project\r\nAfter you have set up your project directory, open the file 00_start.R in the R folder. Add the details of your project, fill in the readme, add a MIT license (if needed) and add package dependencies.\r\n\r\nInstall Common Packages\r\nYou can install the packages that are most commonly used in our department via install_d6_packages():\r\n\r\n\r\nd6::install_d6_packages()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that this function is going to check preinstalled versions and will only install packages that are not installed with your current R version.\r\nAgain, there is an arguement geo so you can decide if you want to install common geodata packages as well (which is the default). If you are not intending to process geodata, set geo to FALSE:\r\n\r\n\r\nd6::install_d6_packages(geo = FALSE)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe default packages that are going to be installed are:\r\n\r\ntidyverse (tibble, dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, readr, forecats, stringr, purrr), lubridate, here, vroom, patchwork, usethis\r\n\r\nThe following packages will be installed in case you specify geo = TRUE:\r\n\r\nrgdal, geos, raster, sp, sf, tmap\r\n\r\n\r\nUse Custom Rmarkdown Templates\r\nThe package also provides several templates for your scripts. In Rstudio, navigate to File > New File > RMarkdown... > Templates and choose the template you want to use. All templates come with a preformatted YAML header and chunks for the setup.\r\nThe following templates are available for now:\r\nEcoDynIZW Basic: Template for a basic Rmarkdown research report including bits of codes and comments to get started\r\nEcoDynIZW Minimal: Template for an Rmarkdown research report (almost empty)\r\n\r\nRender Rmarkdown Files to Reports\r\nThe render_*() functions take care of knitting your Rmarkdown files into HTML reports. The functions assume that your .Rmd files are saved in the R directory or any subdirectory, and will store the resulting .html files in the according directory, namely ./docs/reports/.\r\nYou can render all .Rmd files that are placed in the R directory and subdirectories in one step:\r\n\r\n\r\nd6::render_all_reports()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also render single Rmarkdown documents via render_report():\r\n\r\n\r\nd6::render_report(\"my-report.Rmd\")\r\nd6::render_report(\"notsurewhybutIhaveasubfolder/my-report.Rmd\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements\r\nThis package would not exist without the work of many great people!\r\nThe code to create the project folder is based on the template package by Francisco Rodriguez-Sanchez (and references therein)\r\nThe 00_start script is inspired by the {golem} package\r\nRstudio for the development of Rmarkdown and all the great things that come with it (knitting, templates, themes, …)\r\nAttribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
